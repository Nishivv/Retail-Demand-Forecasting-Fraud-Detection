**🛍️ Retail Analytics SQL Project
**📌 Project Description
This project focuses on building a Retail Analytics Database from scratch using SQL. It simulates a real-world retail environment by integrating key entities such as Customers, Products, Sales, and Transactions. The goal is to explore retail operations and generate actionable business insights using advanced SQL techniques.

The database is designed to support end-to-end retail analytics tasks, including data cleaning, validation, exploration, and reporting. Key aspects of the project include:

Database Schema Design: Created relational tables with appropriate keys and constraints for referential integrity.

Data Quality Checks: Handled missing values, null checks, duplicate detection, and data validation across entities.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used SQL to assess data distribution, detect outliers, and verify foreign key relationships.

Analytical SQL Queries: Extracted key business insights such as top-performing products, customer segments, revenue trends, and inventory performance.
